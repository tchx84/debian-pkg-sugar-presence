sugar-presence-service 0.83.1 (2008-10-29)
==========================================

Enhancements:

* dev.laptop.org #7581: Don't ignore buddies without keys. This improve
  interoperability with non Sugar client.
* dev.laptop.org #7849: Display PS version in the log.
* Use gconf to get Sugar profile settings.
* dev.laptop.org #8444: Don't rely on the roster to check if a contact handle
is channel specific or not. So PS will properly create Buddy objects discovered
using Gadget. Furthermore, this workaround has the nice side effect to improve
compatibility with bugged shared roster (as the one of ejabberd).

Fixes:

* dev.laptop.org #5618; Discard invalid handles if InspectHandles failed.
